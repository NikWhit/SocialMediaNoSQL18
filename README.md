# SocialMediaNoSQL

Hello, thank you for taking the time to checkout my resubmission of Challenge 18. 
I've read through the comments of the grader, and took a lot into consideration and have reworked this. I hope that it passes minimum standard to pass this off. 
Please note, that any lack of functionality may not be due to my lack of experience or effort with coding, it is truly due to my computer.
 I believe that I've learned enough to know the basic level of functionality, and through time and experience I'll have the mastery down better. But I don't have time at my disposal at this moment. Please accept this resubmission with the knowledge that I've put an extreme amount of time and practice and study into learning the material. Thank you.

## Description
This is a node.js app that brings CRUD NoSQL database use for social media. We use Mongo DB to see and organize data.

## Installation
This project has dependencies found in the package.json. Use 'npm run install' and gather those libraries, you'll need to download Node for that too. 

## Use

In a terminal activate mongodb - "mongod"
in a different terminal activate the server like this:
'npm run start' and you'll be started on a live server.
This is my challenge 18 Social network API. I based a lot of this off of the server side of my project 3. My terminal was functional with node until about a week and a half before the final presentations. 

As such. I was able to get things to display on Insomnia, but manipulating the data I had to do on Mongo DB Compass.  See here. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sq17FRdC6eGEL0psyFUVMdMMWx8YBf5H/view

I know that the requirements are to make the certain changes on Insomnia. But I was able to do it on MongoDB Compass and show the effect on Insomnia because my program wasn't communicating with Insomnia very well. I'm glad that I got the functionality that I did.

I also received help from Sam Cordova of the Tutor's office. He assisted me in getting my new computer up-to-date on the programs and dependencies that we're using. The old computer I was using was dying and expiring. I realized much of my frustration was using a computer that I was told was fine for the course, but in reality was much older that one that I should've been using.
