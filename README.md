 NoSQl Social Media with faulty node modules that wont run to insomnia

This is my challenge 18 Social network API. I based a lot of this off of the server side of my project 3. My terminal was functional with node until about a week and a half before the final presentations. 

My computer is pushing about 8-10 years old. The drivers are getting old and this bootcamp has just about fried it. 

Anyway, what you should be able to do is...
in the terminal, "npm i".
then "npm start". 
you'll be taken to a live server.
Then you can activate that live server through insomnia and upload data into your database, or explore the database, edit the database, or even delete users, thoughts, or reactions on the database.
