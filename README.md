# SocialMediaNoSQL

## Description
This is a node.js app that brings CRUD NoSQL database use for social media. We use Mongo DB to see and organize data.

## Installation
This project has dependencies found in the package.json. Use 'npm run install' and gather those libraries, you'll need to download Node for that too. 

## Use

In a terminal activate mongodb - "mongod"
in a different terminal activate the server like this:
'npm run start' and you'll be started on a live server.
This is my challenge 18 Social network API. I based a lot of this off of the server side of my project 3. My terminal was functional with node until about a week and a half before the final presentations.
